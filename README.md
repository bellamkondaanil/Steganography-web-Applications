# Steganography-web-Applications
A web-based steganography system that allows users to hide and extract secret messages inside images, audio, video, and text files using Least Significant Bit (LSB) and zero-width character techniques. The project is built with FastAPI for the backend and a clean HTML/CSS frontend, making it simple, fast, and user-friendly.
