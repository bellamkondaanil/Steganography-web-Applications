# Steganography-web-Applications
A web-based steganography system that allows users to hide and extract secret messages inside images, audio, video, and text files using Least Significant Bit (LSB) and zero-width character techniques. The project is built with FastAPI for the backend and a clean HTML/CSS frontend, making it simple, fast, and user-friendly.   
This project provides a comprehensive multi-format steganography solution that allows users to securely hide secret messages within images, audio files, video files, and text documents. It supports both encoding and decoding operations across all these media formats. The system uses the Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography technique for images, audio, and video files to embed hidden information without noticeable distortion, while text steganography is implemented using invisible zero-width Unicode characters to ensure complete concealment. The application features a fully web-based interface, eliminating the need for command-line interaction and making it accessible to non-technical users. A FastAPI-powered backend handles all processing through well-defined RESTful endpoints, ensuring fast and reliable performance. The user interface is clean, responsive, and easy to navigate, and cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is enabled to allow seamless interaction across different platforms and environments.

The technology stack for this project includes Python as the core programming language and FastAPI as the backend framework for building high-performance APIs. OpenCV (cv2) and NumPy are used for efficient image and video processing, while the Pillow (PIL) library supports image handling operations. Audio steganography is implemented using the Wave module for direct manipulation of audio frames. The frontend is developed using standard HTML and CSS, providing a simple yet visually appealing user interface that integrates smoothly with the backend services.
